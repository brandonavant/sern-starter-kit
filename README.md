# SERN-stack Demonstration

This application acts as a proof-of-concept for a SERN (SQL-Express-React-Node) application. It can be used as a base / boilerplate for any Express-React-Node based application. The database layer can easily be replaced with any sort of other relational or NoSQL database.

This particular implementation uses SQLite.
